# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	root * /var/www/html
	encode gzip
	file_server
	templates
	handle / {
		rewrite index.html
	}
	log {
		output file /var/log/caddy/access.log {
			roll_size 1gb
			roll_keep 5
			roll_keep_for 720h
		}
	}
}
